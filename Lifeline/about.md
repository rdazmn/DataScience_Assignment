### INTRODUCTION

Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one
person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs
throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can
be implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to
prevent suicide and suicide attempts.
